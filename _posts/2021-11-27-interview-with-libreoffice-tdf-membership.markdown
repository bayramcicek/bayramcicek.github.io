#### Exactly 1 year after first patch

One year ago this month, I sent my [first patch to LibreOffice/core][first-patch] and announced it with a blog post titled [Contributing to LibreOffice: First patch][first-commit-post]. In that day, I couldn't imagine that I would successfully complete GSoC'21 and become a TDF member within 1 year. 

Thanks to LibreOffice community, mentors and developers for their help throughout the journey. Without your help, I couldn't do it.
