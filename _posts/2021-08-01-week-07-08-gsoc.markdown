GSoC progress for week #7 and week #8.

#### Made research on borders in Writer-Tables

- Bug: [tdf#51665][tdf#51665] - Support diagonal borders in TABLEs

In `Table Toolbar > Bordes`, Writer has 8 border frames for each cell, and has 12 border frames for multiple selected cells. With 2 new borders (Diagonal Left/Right), Writer has 14 border frames.

I made research about how applying borders works in Writer-Tables. Then I started to work on it with sending first patchsets as WIP:: [https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/119685][gerrit-119685]

I realized that Calc has diagonal borders feature in both `Format > Cells... > Borders tab` and (Sidebar Tab) `Properties > Cell Appearance`. Next week, I will try to understand how diagonal borders work in Calc cells and will try to implement them in Writer-Tables.
