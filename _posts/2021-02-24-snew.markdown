As explained in this excellent blog post by Yongfu Liao, Jekyll Feed doesn’t allow you to generate an RSS feed for a particular tag or category of posts. However, there is a workaround which you can read more about here and here.

Yongfu shares his modification of the original workaround on Github. This code is really nice because it provides exactly the format of the RSS feed required by R-Bloggers.

All you need to do is to take the code below, paste it into a text editor, and save it as an .xml file. For example, my file is called “feed.r.bloggers.xml.”

Make sure you change the “Author” section in the code to your email address (the name part is optional). Indicate the tag you will use to indicate that a given post is suitable for R-Bloggers. In the example below, I specify: [“R”], meaning all posts with this (case-sensitive) tag will be included in the RSS feed.
