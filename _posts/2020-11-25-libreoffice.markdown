I'm happy to announce that I made my first contribution on [LibreOffice][libre] project.

About 3 weeks ago, I attended [Contributing Free and Open Source Projects with C++][AcikKaynak-github] course by Muhammet Kara. First 3 week of the course, we learned basics of C++. After that week, we sent our first patch with other attendees.

The patch we sent was [Bug 124176 - Use pragma once instead of include guards][Bug_124176] which is an [easy hack][easy_hack]. Easy hacks are great starting points for new developers.

After the first contribution was approved to merge into LibreOffice core repository, LibreOffice team sent an email to congratulate [my first merged patch][merged].

I'm so proud of being a part of the project. Thanks to all LibreOffice teams and developers.
