His shoes are dirty. ->He is cleaning his shoes. ->He has cleaned his shoes.(= his shoes are clean <b>now</b>)
They are at home. ->They are going out. ->They have gone out.(= they are not at home <b>now</b>)

- has cleaned / have gone etc. is the present perfect (have + past participle)

We use the present perfect for an action in the past with a result now:

- I've lost my passport. (= I can't find my passport <b>now</b>)
- 'Where's Rebecca?' 'She's gone to bed.' (= she is in bed <b>now</b>)
- We've bought a new car. (= we have a new car <b>now</b>)
- It's Rachel's birthday tomorrow and I haven't bought her a present. (= I don't have a present for her <b>now</b>)
- 'Bob is away on holiday.' 'Oh, where has he gone?' (= where is he <b>now</b>?)
- Can I take this newspaper? Have you finished with it? (= do you need it <b>now</b>?)
