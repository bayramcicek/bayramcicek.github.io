GSoC progress for week #9.

#### Diagonal borders now accessible from "Table Toolbar > Borders" tab in Calc

Calc has diagonal borders feature in `Format > Cells... > Borders tab` and (Sidebar Tab) `Properties > Cell Appearance`. However, this feature wasn't exist in "Table Toolbar > Borders" tab. With commit [https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/119685][gerrit-119685], Calc can draw diagonal left and diagonal right borders from table toolbar. \o/

This [https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/119685][gerrit-119685] commit had "_(WIP) Support diagonal borders in Writer-Tables_" name before, and I sent 3-4 patchsets for Writer-diagonal-borders, but I made it Calc-specific and changed the title as "_Calc: made diagonal borders accessible in Toolbar>Borders_". The reason of this change is: Writer and Calc use the same Border tab in Table toolbar (svx/source/tbxctrls/tbcontrl.cxx). Therefore I will leave the commit as Calc-specific and will submit a new commit just for Writer-specific. But first, I want to write UItest for Calc-diagonal-borders next week.

Additionaly I want to work on [https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34689][bug34689] - UI scroll problem: Cell with dimensions exceeding screen dimensions impossible to work with.
