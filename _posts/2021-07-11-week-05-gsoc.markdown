GSoC progress for week #5.

### Get rid of Writer-Images

- Bug: [tdf#34438][tdf#34438] (Image-Group) - [feature request, FORMATTING] group selection does not work with raster images.

Last week I shared a blog post of my research on this bug [here][gsoc-w3-4] and this week I posted a comment about my 2-week research on the bug page of tdf#34438 [here][comment-me], and Regina Henschel replied with a comment [here][comment-regina] (thanks for the reply):

> [...] So from my point of view we should get rid of Writer-images. But that is a long way. [...] So to get rid of Writer-images it would be necessary to implement the services, which are provided by Writer-images for Draw-images too ...

So, the last decision is: get rid of writer-images. Convert them into drawing objects ,but also implement the writer-images services/attributes to drawing-images. Since there are lots of things to do and we have only 5 week left after the first evaluations week, I prefer to work on this issue after GSoC with a huge free time. Also, I want to work on other bugs too, not only one.

### Prevent jump to top of the comment view / Writer-comments

- Bug: [tdf#91519][tdf#91519]: Jump of document canvas view to the top of the comment disrupts editing of long comments.
- Commit: [https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/118638][tdf#91519-commit] (_waiting for review_)

In Writer,
there are 3 issues about comment section:

- comment section scrolls to top of its view when clicking inside a comment view.

- clicking inside a comment view, scrolls the view to old cursor location automatically (if old cursor out of the visible area).

- comment section scrolls automatically to the old *selected* text (if it's out of visible area) when clicking inside the Writer canvas view.

</p>

    <i>Another annoying issue: multi-selection (after a certain changes in the code)</i>
</p>

### Technical Details

- <b>Fix for "autoscroll to old cursor location"</b>

{% highlight cpp %}
void SwAnnotationWin::ActivatePostIt()
{
    /*...*/

    // prevent autoscroll to the old cursor location
    // when cursor out of visible area
    GetOutlinerView()->ShowCursor(false);

    /*...*/
}
{% endhighlight %}

`GetOutlinerView()->ShowCursor();` has a default value `true` if no argument passed in. I realized that this line causes the autoscroll to the old cursor location, and setting it to `false` solved the issue.

- <b>Fix for "jumping to the top of comment view"</b>

{% highlight cpp %}
bool SwAnnotationWin::SetActiveSidebarWin()
{
    if (mrMgr.GetActiveSidebarWin() == this)
        return false;
    const bool bLockView = mrView.GetWrtShell().IsViewLocked();
    mrView.GetWrtShell().LockView( true );
    mrMgr.SetActiveSidebarWin(this);

    // don't understand why we set `bLockView` here?
    mrView.GetWrtShell().LockView( bLockView );
    
    return true;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Just remove unnecessary `const bool bLockView = mrView.GetWrtShell().IsViewLocked();` line, set `.LockView( bLockView );` to `.LockView( true );` because we activating `SetActiveSidebarWin` here, it should be `true` and this fixes the jumping to the top of comment view issue with:

{% highlight cpp %}
void SwAnnotationWin::UnsetActiveSidebarWin()
{
    if (mrMgr.GetActiveSidebarWin() != this)
        return;
    mrView.GetWrtShell().LockView( true );
    mrMgr.SetActiveSidebarWin(nullptr);
    mrView.GetWrtShell().LockView( false ); // set false
}
{% endhighlight %}

- <b>Fix for "scrolling automatically to the old *selected* text"</b>

Steps to reproduce: (in comments section)

    - select text (2-3 words for example)
    - scroll selected text to unvisible area (up or down)
    - click into the writer document canvas

**Result**: comment writing area scrolls to unvisible selected text(s) (it becomes visible)

**Expected result**: don't scroll to the selected area, just make it unmarked.

{% highlight cpp %}
void EditView::SetSelection( const ESelection& rESel )
{
    /*...*/

    pImpEditView->DrawSelectionXOR();
    pImpEditView->SetEditSelection( aNewSelection );
    pImpEditView->DrawSelectionXOR();
    bool bGotoCursor = pImpEditView->DoAutoScroll();

    ShowCursor( bGotoCursor );
}
{% endhighlight %}

`ShowCursor( bGotoCursor );` causes the jumping when deactivating the comment canvas (when clicking into writer document canvas).

Just made it to:
<pre>
    if (HasSelection())
        ShowCursor( bGotoCursor );
</pre>

and it's solved.

- <b>When typing, current view have to jump to typing location</b>

After the certain changes in the code, I realized that the writer document canvas doesn't jump to typing location. After a long process of debugging in the code base, found that comment section LockView doesn't set to false: 

{% highlight cpp %}
void SidebarTextControl::LoseFocus()
{
    // write the visible text back into the SwField
    mrSidebarWin.UpdateData();

    WeldEditView::LoseFocus();
    if ( !mrSidebarWin.IsMouseOver() )
    {
        Invalidate();
    }

    // I just added this line here and set it to false.
    mrSidebarWin.LockView(false);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Before the `mrSidebarWin.LockView();`, I created a new method in `sw/source/uibase/docvw/AnnotationWin2.cxx` to have access `LockView()`:

{% highlight cpp %}
void SwAnnotationWin::LockView(bool bLock)
{
    mrView.GetWrtShell().LockView( bLock );
}
{% endhighlight %}
